# Intent Detection using different models

## Using LSTM
A demo of Intent Detection using LSTM sequence model on Snips dataset.  
Provided as part of the article [Intent Detection using Sequence Models](https://medium.com/holler-developers/intent-detection-using-sequence-models-ddae9cd861ee). 

## Using LLM
Based on a large langage bert model pretrained on AMAZON Massive dataset, finetuned to the given dataset to generate a model giving an accuracy of 0.85 on the test set.
